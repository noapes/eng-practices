# Google 工程实践指南

Google has many generalized engineering practices that cover all languages and
all projects. These documents represent our collective experience of various
best practices that we have developed over time. It is possible that open source
projects or other organizations would benefit from this knowledge, so we work to
make it available publicly when possible.

Google 拥有许多涵盖所有语言和项目通用实践．这些文档代表着我们这些年来最佳的集体实践经验．开源项目或者组织可能从这些知识中受益，因此，我们将在可能的情况公开这些文档．

Currently this contains the following documents:

当前公开文档包含以下文档：

*   [Google's Code Review Guidelines](review/index.md), which are actually two
    separate sets of documents:
    *   [The Code Reviewer's Guide](review/reviewer/index.md)
    *   [The Change Author's Guide](review/developer/index.md)

## 术语

There is some Google-internal terminology used in some of these documents, which
we clarify here for external readers:
有些文档存在一些 Google 内部使用的术语，我们将在这里未外部用户说明：


*   **CL**: Stands for "changelist," which means one self-contained change that
    has been submitted to version control or which is undergoing code review.
    Other organizations often call this a "change" or a "patch."
*   **CL**: 代表 `changelist`, 也就是那些已经提交到版本控制系统或者正在进行代码评审的自包含改变.
    其他组织经常把他成为`变化`或者`补丁`.
*   **LGTM**: Means "Looks Good to Me." It is what a code reviewer says when
    approving a CL.
*   **LGTM**: ＂我认为挺好的．＂这是代码评审人员赞同CL时话语．
